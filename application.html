       <h1>Overview</h1>
       <p>This game is a strategy number based game where you try to carefully and stratigeically clear the mines within a set area. Flag the mines but do not land on them!</p>
       <h2>How to play</h2>
       <p>
       You begin by clicking on a space. At the start of the game all of the spaces will appear blank as pictured. You click on a space to reveal the number of mines present around a space. Now that you have clicked on a space, what do the numbers mean? </p>

        <ol>
          <li>one mine is present in the 8 squares surrounding the space that has the number</li>
          <li>Two mines are present in the 8 squares surrounding the space that has the number</li>
          <li>Three mines are present in the 8 squares surrounding the space that has the number</li>
          <li>four mines are present in the 8 squares surrounding the space that has the number</li>
          <li>five mines are present in the 8 squares surrounding the space that has the number</li>
          <li>six mines are present in the 8 squares surrounding the space that has the number</li>
          <li>seven mines are present in the 8 squares surrounding the space that has the number</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Flagging Mines</h2>
        <p>Now that you think you have found a mine, how do you mark it so you do not land on it? Using the context clues of the numbers around the empty spaces you can determine where the mines are by simple process of elimination.
